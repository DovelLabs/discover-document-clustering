- If a word does not have a spaCy vector, remove it from the entity lists, but store it somehow in a file. That way, we can aggregate the list of terms that aren't vectorized by spaCy and we can improve the model by vectorizing those words
- How do we incorporate 'term frequency' into the model? I want to weight the the terms that occur most frequently somehow, but I'm not sure how to do it

- Instead of finding the "top #" of entities from each doc, would it be better to extract the "top %" of entities for each document? That way, smaller documents can be better summarized by their key entities with factoring in how long the document is (and vice versa)

- Use pattern matching to match certain terms based on the context of the files
- Update the output file to include key entities and guess about what 'topic' the file dicusses
- Tweak the spaCy model to incorporate unique orgs, people, and other named entities so that tagging is better (either add to existing categories or create new categories)
- Tweak pipeline components (POS tagger, text classifier - how a text is classified)
- Customize the tokenizer (add rules and exceptions to split text differently)
