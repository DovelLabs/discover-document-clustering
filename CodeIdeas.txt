-If a word does not have a spaCy vector, either remove it or create a vector?

- Use pattern matching to match certain terms based on the context of the files
- Update the output file to include key entities and guess about what 'topic' the file dicusses
- Tweak the spaCy model to incorporate unique orgs, people, and other named entities so that tagging is better (either add to existing categories or create new categories)
- Tweak pipeline components (POS tagger, text classifier - how a text is classified)
- Customize the tokenizer (add rules and exceptions to split text differently)
